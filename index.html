            <p>Good day to whoever will read this. As you have and will see, my name is Augustine Ogubie. I am a young 20 year old who has recently returned from serving a fulltime mission. I enjoy learning in general, but what I enjoy learning about the most is vehicles and technologies. I can be very active and have played a variety of sports throughout my high-school, including soccer, basketball, squash, table-tennis and rugby.</p>`

            <p>South Africa is my home, I've lived here all my life. Most especially Pretoria, the executive capital of South Africa, is a beautiful city set against the backdrop of the Magaliesberg mountains. It is known for its parks and gardens, and there are many historical landmarks to explore. The city center is home to government buildings as well as museums, art galleries and restaurants</p>
